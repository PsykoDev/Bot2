### About TeraClient
This is just a simple fork of [TeraProxy](https://github.com/tera-proxy/tera-proxy) that merges it with some things from the old [tera-discord-relay](https://github.com/meishuu/tera-discord-relay) and supports connecting to the servers without a game client. Every mod supported by [TeraToolbox](https://github.com/tera-toolbox/tera-toolbox/) should be supported here. Keep in mind that because there is no game client, all interaction with the server must be scripted.
